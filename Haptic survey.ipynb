    "### Master and slave subsystems\n",
    "* concepts:\n",

    "\t* the most popular haptic interface is the Geomagic Touch (formly known as Phantom Omni)\n",
    "\t* Many haptic interfaces, may also be entirely wearable or have wearable components in order to provide tactile feedback more effectively\n",
    "\t* The hardware designparameters of haptic devices and the number and type of sensors and actuators determine the amount of data the device will output or needs as input.\n",
    "\t* The slave haptic subsystem can be either a physical device which interacts with a physical remote environment or a virtual pointer of any form (e.g. a virtual hand) that operates in a virtual environment.\n",
    "\t* By employing the tactile or kinesthetic modalities these systems are called Collaborative-Haptic Virtual Environments (C-HAVE)\n",
    "### challenges of teleoperation systems (section 2)\n",
    "* Two main challenges for designing a reliable teleoperation sysetem.\n",
    "\t*  A high packet rate is needed but may lead to the consumption of a large amount of network resources in combination with the transmission of audio and video data and leads to inefficient data communication.\n",

    "## Haptic communication over the internet (section 3)\n",
    "### Haptic  communication protocols and frameworks\n",
    "* Common performance parameters:\n",
    "\t* Network delay is the average time needed for a packet to travel from the input of the communication channel to its output.\n",
    "\t* Jitter is the result of the influence delay has to packets independently, formally known as Packet Delay Variation (PDV) which affects the packet sequence.\n",
    "\t* Packet loss is a consequence of the network traffic congestion.\n",
    "\t* Data rate of the communication channel. This can be affected by the sampling frequency, the sample resolution and the protocol overhead.\n",
    "* Transport layer\n",

    "* Application layer\n",
    "\t* Table II: Compareson of application layer protocols\n",
    "### Provision of QoS in the network\n",
    "* Number of approaches have been proposed to provide QoS including: relative priority marking, service marking, label switching, static per-hop classification, Integrated Services (IntServ) and Differentiated Services (DiffServ).\n",
    "* The IntServ architecture relies on the storage of information in all routers of the network in terms of flows that will pass through them.\n",
    "* DiffServ is not providing QoS to separate flows. Instead, it classifies flows by labeling the data streams.\n",
    "* Two important mechanisms of DiffServ are the Expedited Forwarding PHB (EF PHB) and the Assured Forwarding PHB (AF PHB).\n",
    "### Network security\n",
    "Nowadays security threats of CPSs are not focused on communication standards only. All layers of communication, from physical to application, can be targeted.\n",
    "## Haptic data reduction and compression\n",
    "5G networks have big data rate capabilities to cover the haptic data of a user easily, therefore, it's required to explore and improve haptic data reduction and compression methods.\n",
    "### Kinesthetic data reduction\n",
    "Kinesthetic data reduction techniques are mainly based on two approaches of statistical and perceptual schemes.\n",
    "* Statistical schemes\n",
    "* Perceptual schemes\n",
    "* Perceptual schemes with predictive coding\n",
    "### Tactile data reduction\n",
    "The kinesthetic signals involve large amplitude low frequency force feedback and were found lacking in realism due to the absence of high-frequency transients and small-scale surface details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessary step before compressing the vibrotactile signals is to model them. Paper listed some works and said: \"<b>The above works, however, are not optimized for compression.</b>\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It must be noted that there is currently no\n",
    "objective quality metric, such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS), for the evaluation of vibrotactile signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Haptic control system approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control architectures\n",
    "The two most common generic control architectures, based on the number of communication channels the system uses, are the two-channel (2CH) and the four-channel (4CH) architectures.\n",
    "### Transparency and stability\n",
    "\n",
    "A fully transparent system is a system in which telepresence is a flawless and seamless experience.\n",
    "A stable system must always have bounded output for a bounded input.\n",
    "Based on linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics in the Laplace domain, maximum transparency is achieved when the human and environment impedances are matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passivity-based control\n",
    "\n",
    "* Passivity-based control methods have been applied to haptic communication systems in order to compensate for time delays or data loss. Due to its effectiveness in non-linear control systems it has been thoroughly studied in teleoperation systems.\n",
    "* Nonetheless, the passivity condition applies only if all the system components are or are assumed to be passive.\n",
    "* In general, a teleoperation system can be modeled in various ways, such as the two-port network model or the port-Hamiltonian system approach.\n",
    "* Since the communication network of a TPTA framework introduces delays, which can be represented in a control architecture by active elements, it is were passivity-based control needs to be applied.\n",
    "* Network delay, especially when it is considered as timevarying, becomes a hindrance for the synchronization of master and slave positioning and the transmission of the human operator’s movement trajectory or the remote environment’s force feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wave-variable control methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of wave-variables used in haptic communication systems by algorithms created to ensure stability and transparency between the master and slave device when time delay is introduced.\n",
    "A quantitative comparison of the performance between the two-channel and the four-channel wave-based control schemes revealed that the four channels of the 4CH architecture can be reduced to three and also achieve better performance than the 2CH architecture.\n",
    "wave variables can also be used in multiple-DoF\n",
    "teleoperation systems by adopting more general equations that incorporate impedance matrices, also called scaling matrices.\n",
    "* With the adoption of the scattering transformation, converting power variables to wave variables raises important issues.\n",
    "\t* On one hand, power variables preserve passivity, on the other hand, they also introduce desynchronization and the phenomenon of wave reflection which disrupts the system transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time-domain passivity control (read paper)\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach has gained interest during the past few years due to its simplicity and robustness to communication delays.\n",
    "The basic concept behind time-domain passivity control is to monitor the energy flowing to and from the master, the slave side or both in real time using a passivity observer (PO) which can be placed in series or in parallel to the communication channel.\n",
    "The communication channel equivalent is called Time Delay Power Network (TDPN) and it is in the form of a two-port subsystem that can be coupled with a passivity controller. Another differentiation of this framework lies in the possible structures of the proposed architecture as it further disambiguates the network channel representation, with regard to the energy flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-mediated teleoperation approach\n",
    "(The point)\n",
    "To guarantee both the system stability and transparency at the same time in the presence of arbitrary communication delay, the concept of the Model-Mediated Teleoperation Approach\n",
    "(MMTA) has been proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "See Fig 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "MMTA is using the environment model to compensate for the delays allowing the user to interact only with the estimated model of the remote environment.\n",
    "### Smith Predictor and Communication Disturbance Observers\n",
    "\n",
    "The Smith predictor, is using a plant model transfer function and a time delay model to compensate for the network delays in the\n",
    "communication.\n",
    "The concepts of network disturbance (ND) and communication disturbance observer (CDOB) have been proposed in order to compensate for time delays. Augmented versions of the CDOB can also be used for the four-channel architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other control schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "Control schemes which are not based on the passivity of the system.\n",
    "input-to-state stable (ISS) approach to guarantee the stability of teleoperation systems.It allows a bigger output energy and is less conservative compared to the passivity-based control schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joint control scheme and data reduction\n",

    "* Haptic data reduction + TDPA\n",
